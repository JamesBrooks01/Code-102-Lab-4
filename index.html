        <p>This image is my favorite image of Star Wars as it just shows the actors having fun by making an approximation of the Star Wars poster with ordinary objects</p>
        <p>Star Wars was one of the most influential movie franchises to my current interests and hobbies. I first watched Star Wars on our old VHS player in our spare bedroom and I have loved the franchise ever since. My favorite of the original trilogy is Return of the Jedi.<br>
        I perfer that one because of how it neatly wrapped up the story of the characters while leaving room for imagination for what came afterwards. And that one of my favorite scenes in the franchise is the last part of the duel between Luke and Vader.<br>
        It to me is a masterpiece of a scene formed by all its parts playing off of each other in a way that enhances the whole experience. The music in the background that plays as Vader taunts Luke then peaks when Luke finally gives in to his anger, then fading slowly as he realizes what he'd been about to do,<br>
        The acting, from the menacing Vader to the suddenly angerd Luke, to the lighting of the scene itself. To me, there are few scenes in the rest of the franchise that even come close to it.</p>
